# MineCoin
A cryptocurrency for Mines ParisTech


### What is it ?

The MineCoin is a cryptocurrency which is meant to be used within the Mines ParisTech community. It is using the same mechanics as Ethereum. This repo is hosting useful documentation and various tools that should make the token easier to use for people who are not used to command line and nerdy bullshit, such as GUI transaction tools, or a currency exchange platform.

### Why ?

Several reasons :

   1. Eh, why not ?
   2. Building this project is a good way to learn by practicing for all involved students.
   3. This is a good way to make people more familiar with the underlying technologies behind cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications, because this kind of stuff is definitely hard to get.
   4. Once the technical infrastructure will be ready, another challenge will arise : maintaining a healthy socio-economical context that will prevent the MineCoin from crashing and being forgotten. This is no longer a matter of coding skills, but a matter of "macro"-economical policy, social-engineering, and accurate understanding of *what a currency is,  why it has value, and why/how its value can vary*. That's what we call "_competence transverse_".
